# Prelude

Peer review is often conducted on assignments to provide valuable, yet constructive feedback to help one improve their learning and refine their skills. However, it is far more difficult for one to judge their own work and review it themselves, but this task is equally as important, if not more important as peer review. Thus, in this blog, you will read about my critique for my own work.
