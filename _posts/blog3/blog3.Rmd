# Prelude

Peer review is often conducted on assignments to provide valuable, yet constructive feedback to help one improve their learning and refine their skills. However, it is far more difficult for one to judge their own work and review it themselves, but this task is equally as important, if not more important as peer review. Thus, in this blog, you will read about my critique for my own work.

# Introducing my Shiny app

The Shiny app I created is called "COVID-19 rattles the World" and the purpose of this app is to demonstrate how the coronavirus has impacted the world. Through line graphs, I have demonstrated how the distribution of confirmed cases and daily cases have varied from February - October. I also dedicated a section to focus on Australia and used a map to show how the cases and deaths differentiate across states.

My app has an interactive interface, whereby any user can change input selections based on options I have provided so that they can enjoy a more hands-on experience! Some of the input selections on my app are:

**Selection of states for the Australia section** : a user can select any of the 8 Australian states to see how the confirmed case count varies across states.
**Selection of countries** : a user can select any country to visualize its distribution of cumulative cases and daily cases.
**Selection of a date range** : a user can select a date range to see how case counts have changed during a specific time period in a particular country.
