# Prelude

Peer review is often conducted on assignments to provide valuable, yet constructive feedback to help one improve their learning and refine their skills. Thus, in this blog, you will read my evaluation of my colleague's work.

# Introducing the R package

The “covidpkg” is a package created by Yuqi Wang. This package provides me (the user) an opportunity to launch a shiny application and interact with it to visualize the impact of coronavirus in terms of cases and deaths in Australia and Canada.

# Evaluation

### What did I think this package would do? Did it do it?

Before launching the application, I expected the package to show me how the number of cases differentiated between Australia and Canada. In addition, I was expecting that the author of the package would take it one step further and show the distribution of covid cases in all the states of Australia and Canada. After launching the application, the package showed me the distribution of cases and deaths between Australia and Canada on a line chart across a time period from February 2020 to October 2020. It also displayed a table that allowed me to change dates and visualize how the cumulative case and death count have been increasing during the specific time period I selected. Unfortunately, there was no breakdown of case and death count by states as I had hoped for.

### Are there improvements that could be made to the code? Are there improvements that could be made to the shiny app inside the package? Is the documentation sufficient to get started?

There are improvements that can be made to the code that launched the application. For example, instead of reading in the data in the app.R file, the creator could create an “extdata” folder in the same directory as the “inst” folder. This will help them read in the data into the “data-raw” folder as well. Currently, the creator has 2 of the same data files in two separate folders; each file taking up a space of 2.6 Mb. Although this is a relatively small size, if a larger data file had been used, it would take a much longer time to load. Thus, it would be more efficient to just load in the data to one folder, hence my suggestion to create the “extdata” folder. 

Additionally, improvements that could be made inside the shiny app is that the creator could include sections. As of now, there is a lot being displayed on just a single webpage, thus having different sections by using a ‘tabPanel’ could give a better layout and flow to the content on the app. 

Unfortunately, there isn’t sufficient information in the documentation to get started. The creator has given documentation on the datasets and launch_app() function used, however the information provided could be improved. For example, in the datasets documentation, information about the variables and what they represent could be included. For the launch_app() function, an example of how to use this function would be beneficial for the user, especially if the user is not literate in programming language. Lastly, the user has written an R script for their ui and server functions, but this was not documented properly and as such I was unable to view the documentation.

### What I've learned from reviewing the package?

After reviewing the package, I was pleased to be able to view the shiny app simply by just using a launch_app() function. The app itself has interactive features like selecting a date range and selecting a country. This allowed me to compare the number of cases between Australia and Canada. I learnt something interesting in regards to border policies implemented by both countries. Australia has a stricter border policy whereby nobody can enter or exit the country unless for very special and serious circumstances. Whereas Canada allowed people to exit the country but prohibited entry of travelers from high-risk countries. The difference in border control is perhaps why Australia only recorded about 27,000 cases and 895 deaths whereas Canada has over 168,000 cases and 9504 deaths.

# Appendix

## Package Review

### Documentation

- [x] **Installation instructions:** There were installation instructions found in the README file.
- [x] **Vignette(s):** The vignette does run successfully in my local machine. It provides information such as what the app does and guidelines. However, there is no information on demonstrating the use of datasets and how a user can work with the data to visualize certain analytics themselves.
- [ ] **Function documentation:** There was documentation for only 1 exported function, the launch_app() function. The ui and server functions had not been documented properly and were not included in the “man” folder, thus there was no documentation available for these functions in the R help.
- [ ] **Examples:** For the launch_app() documentation, there were no examples provided. However, the function runs successfully on my local machine. I could not run the other functions that were created because they had not been properly exported in the R script.

### Functionality

- [x] **Installation:** The installation of the package succeeds on my local machine.
- [x] **Functionality:** The functional claims have been confirmed.
- [ ] **Automated tests:** The tests implemented did not run as it should. The creator commented on one of the test files, thus a test on the ui-side function could not be carried out in the way it should. The test file for the server-side function was not changed from the default setting and it did not match the function created by the author.
